EurocracyGolf
============

Eurocracy Golf is a protoype for a 3D minigolf game with European-themed courses. In contrast to similar games, this game allows the player to see and control exactly where their golf ball is going to go. The difficulty then lies in controlling the speed at which the player hits the ball. This prototype was developed in Unity3D using C#. To achieve this kind of gameplay, however, it was necessary to implement my own physics calculations instead of using Unity3D's physics engine.
